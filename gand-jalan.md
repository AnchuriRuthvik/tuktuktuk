## ** let's see how this goes**


### Ankit's slog 5/9/20

## CP
`Heaps`: Min Heap Construction
<br/>
`Recursion`: Permutations, powerset
<br/>
`Sort`: Heap Sort
<br/>
`Search`: Search in sorted Matrix
`String` : Longest palindromic substring
<br/>
`Tries` : Suffix Trie Construction
`Hash Tables`: Suffix Trie Construction
`YouTube`: started watching HackerRank's DS playlist. Looks pretty neat

## Thoughts
Permutations question is pretty amazing and confusing but the swapping concept looks pretty useful for gen algo application. I have a pretty cool timeline map of its explanation. Will upload it with code

#### Code will be uploaded in proper sub-folders by Sunday 6th September 8pm latest
