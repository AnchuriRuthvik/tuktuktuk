# MOST IMPORTANT BIT OF GYAAN

0) **COURSES => Please go through every one of them diligently. I have explored a lot and filtered out the most important courses for you**

1) **STUDY NOTES => Diligently read attached notes. I have put too much pain and effort to make em concise, relevant and valuable both from exam-clearing as well as platform-using point of view.**

2) **PRACTICE TESTS => Diligently solve all the practice papers and review mistakes. It is the key to clearing these exams. Trust me, just notes and courses WILL NOT SUFFICE**

3) **SLIDES => View them only after completing course. I have also attached some useful course slides to be viewed as flash cards before the exam. Optional to view them**

**LET'S DO THIS => Feel free to contact me at ankit.sanghavi87@gmail.com for any sort of further guidance**

**You got this !**
